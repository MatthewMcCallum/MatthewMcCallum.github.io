    <td>In this lesson it was mainly trial and error, I was trying to import an image as my background on my github page as for some unknown reason my last image wouldn't appear behind the transparent layer</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Distractions, i get distracted a lot, any sort of thing that happens around means i will lose focus on the task i have been given and will be more interested. I think i just need to try and stay focused on my task even if i dint mind it fun or interesting i should just carry on ignoring my surroundings</td>
