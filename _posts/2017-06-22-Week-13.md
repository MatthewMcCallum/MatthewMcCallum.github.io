  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson i was trying to learn by in effect starting again and doing it all again. This helps as once you've done something and do it for quite a long time then you can get a bit rusty and occasionally completely forget about what you used to do</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some of the stuff i couldn't remember so i had to look stuff up or ask people to help me, this would frustrate me and then i wouldn't be as productive as i should be as i was annoyed</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try and keep a positive attitude to my work and will try and do it by myself as that way i will learn more and become a better computerer</td>
